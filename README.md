# üì° Analog Communication Systems Simulation (FM & VSB) with GNU Radio

This project details the design, simulation, and analysis of two fundamental **Analog Modulation Systems: Frequency Modulation (FM)** and **Vestigial Sideband (VSB)** using the **GNU Radio** software-defined radio (SDR) toolkit. Complete transmitter and receiver flowgraphs were built in GNU Radio Companion (GRC) and analyzed under the influence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).

## üéØ Project Goals & Implemented Systems

The core objective was to translate theoretical concepts of analog communications into practical SDR simulations, demonstrating the end-to-end process of modulation, transmission over a noisy channel, and demodulation.

### 1. Frequency Modulation (FM)
The implementation includes:
* **FM Transmitter:** Generation of a sinusoidal message signal and subsequent FM modulation.
* **Noisy Channel:** Introduction of **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** to simulate real-world channel conditions.
* **FM Receiver:** Utilization of a phase-based demodulator (e.g., Quadrature Demod) for signal recovery.

### 2. Vestigial Sideband (VSB) Modulation
The implementation includes:
* **VSB Transmitter:** Creation of a VSB signal using appropriate shaping filters (e.g., Band Pass Filters) to suppress one sideband while retaining a portion (vestige) of the other.
* **VSB Receiver:** Implementation of **Synchronous Demodulation** (using a multiplier and Low Pass Filters) to recover the baseband signal.

## üìä Analysis and Evaluation

The performance of both FM and VSB systems was rigorously evaluated based on the following metrics, detailed in the final report:

1.  **Time Domain Analysis:** Comparing the original message signal, the modulated signal, and the recovered demodulated signal to assess the clarity and fidelity of recovery.
2.  **Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT):** Observing the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** to analyze the required bandwidth and spectral efficiency of FM versus VSB.
3.  **Signal Quality:** Quantitatively assessing the impact of AWGN on the communication link by measuring the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** of the output signal.

## üöÄ How to Run the Simulation

To execute the simulations, you must have the **GNU Radio** software suite installed on your system.

1.  **Run via GRC (Recommended):**
    * Open `FM.grc` (or the VSB flowgraph file) in **GNU Radio Companion**.
    * Click the **Generate Flow Graph** icon (gear) and then the **Execute** icon (play button) to launch the simulation and visualize the Time/FFT Sink windows.
